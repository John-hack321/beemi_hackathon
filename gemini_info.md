Overview
A real-time collaborative storytelling game for two streamers where chat participants suggest words, streamers choose from top suggestions to build a story together, and audiences can vote for their favorite streamer's contributions.
Game Concept Analysis
Core Mechanics

Two-streamer collaboration: Alternating turns between streamers
5-second decision window: Creates urgency and momentum
Chat-driven word suggestions: Audience actively participates in story creation
Real-time voting system: Viewers support their preferred streamer (1 for Streamer 1, 2 for Streamer 2)
Auto-fallback system: Random word selection if streamer doesn't choose in time
Single-word constraint: Maintains story flow and prevents spam

Technical Implementation Guide
Phase 1: Core Game Architecture
1.1 Game State Management
javascriptgameState = {
  // Core game data
  currentStory: [],
  currentTurn: 1 or 2,
  gamePhase: 'waiting' | 'collecting' | 'choosing' | 'completed',
  
  // Player management
  streamer1: { name, score, connectionId },
  streamer2: { name, score, connectionId },
  
  // Word system
  currentWordOptions: [word1, word2, word3, word4],
  wordSuggestions: Map(word -> count),
  
  // Timing
  turnStartTime: timestamp,
  turnDuration: 5000ms,
  
  // Voting
  votes: { streamer1: count, streamer2: count }
}
1.2 Chat Processing Pipeline

Input Filtering: Accept only single words (no spaces, special chars)
Word Validation: Filter inappropriate content, validate language
Frequency Counting: Track word suggestion frequency
Top 4 Selection: Get most suggested words every collection cycle
Vote Detection: Identify "1", "2", streamer names, or "like" messages

1.3 Turn Cycle Flow
1. START TURN (currentTurn streamer)
   ├─ Clear previous word options
   ├─ Begin 15-second word collection
   ├─ Display "Collecting words..." status
   
2. COLLECTION PHASE (15 seconds)
   ├─ Process incoming chat messages
   ├─ Count word frequency
   ├─ Update live word suggestions display
   
3. SELECTION PHASE (5 seconds)
   ├─ Present top 4 words as buttons
   ├─ Start 5-second countdown timer
   ├─ Wait for streamer selection
   ├─ If no selection: choose random word
   
4. WORD ADDITION
   ├─ Add chosen word to story
   ├─ Update story display with animation
   ├─ Award points based on voting
   ├─ Switch turns (1→2 or 2→1)
   
5. REPEAT until story completion (12-15 words)
Phase 2: Beemi Integration
2.1 Event Handlers Setup
javascript// Chat message processing
beemi.streams.onChat(handleChatMessage)
beemi.multiplayer.on('room-event', handleRoomEvent)

// Multiplayer events
beemi.multiplayer.on('player-joined', handleStreamerJoin)
beemi.multiplayer.on('player-left', handleStreamerLeave)
2.2 Message Processing Logic
javascriptfunction handleChatMessage(event) {
  const message = extractMessage(event) // Handle multiple formats
  
  // Vote detection
  if (isVoteMessage(message.text)) {
    processVote(message.text, message.user)
    return
  }
  
  // Word suggestion detection
  if (isSingleWord(message.text) && gameState.gamePhase === 'collecting') {
    addWordSuggestion(message.text.toLowerCase())
  }
}
2.3 Real-time Updates

Story Display: Animate new word additions
Word Buttons: Live update with vote counts
Timer: Visual countdown for urgency
Score Updates: Real-time score changes based on votes
Turn Indicator: Clear visual of whose turn it is

Phase 3: Advanced Features
3.1 Scoring System
javascript// Base scoring
- Word selection: +10 points
- Audience vote: +5 points per vote
- Story completion bonus: +50 points
- Time bonus: +2 points for quick selection

// Advanced scoring
- Coherence bonus: AI/rule-based story flow analysis
- Engagement bonus: Chat activity increase after word
- Creativity bonus: Unexpected but fitting word choices
3.2 UI Components
Story Display Component

Scrolling text with word highlighting
Color coding for each streamer's contributions
Word-by-word reveal animations
Story progress indicator

Word Selection Interface

4 large, clickable buttons
Live vote counts on each word
Visual feedback for selection

3.3 Failsafe Mechanisms

Connection Loss: Pause game, reconnect logic
Low Participation: Seed words if chat is quiet
Inappropriate Content: Real-time word filtering
Streamer Absence: Auto-skip after timeout
Technical Issues: Game state persistence

Phase 4: Optimization & Polish
4.1 Performance Considerations

Efficient chat message processing (debouncing)
Memory management for word suggestions
Smooth animations without lag
Mobile-responsive design

4.2 User Experience Enhancements

Visual Feedback: Button press animations, score pop-ups
Audio Cues: Timer warnings, selection confirmations
Story Categories: Genre selection before game start
Replay System: Save and share completed stories

4.3 Analytics & Engagement

Track popular word combinations
Monitor game completion rates
Analyze audience participation patterns
A/B test timing configurations

Implementation Priority
